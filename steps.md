Go to "developer.salesforce.com"
Click "Sign Up" at the top right.

You can create your first developer edition here, or you can create an additional one by choosing a different Username.
The "Username" must be unique among all Salesforce orgs. It must be structured like an e-mail address, but does not need to be a real one.
Example: "johndoe@mymadeupcompany.com"

Check the real email you used to sign up with and confirm your DE (Developer Edition) in the email sent to you by clicking "Verify Account".
Now set up a password given the criteria and a Security Question/Answer.

Click "X" at the top right of any windows that appear to take any tours of Salesforce. 

Click the Gear icon at the top right and click "Setup".
Enter "My Domain" in the setup Quick Find search box on the left and click on My Domain. Check the availability of your subdomain and request an available one.
Enter your preferred domain in the box between "https://" and "-dev-ed.my.salesforce.com/"
Whatever you enter in that box will be combined with the two bits of text to the left and right to create the new URL that you type in your browser to get to your site.
Example: "https://wafflestudios-dev-ed.my.salesforce.com/"
When you find one which is available, click "Register Domain".

An email will be sent for you to verify this new change. You may have to wait a few minutes for the email to arrive.
Click the link for your unique URL in the email and test it by logging in using the same Username and password you set previously. The images on this login page are able to be customized.

Click the Gear icon at the top right and click "Setup".
Enter "My Domain" in the setup Quick Find search box on the left and click on My Domain.
Click "Deploy to Users" so that anyone can use the link to your new company URL.
